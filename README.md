-- Challenge/Deck Backs
  
  This is actually two simple (I cannot emphasise enough: *simple*) texture mods: one that changes just the challenge deck back (Challenge-Backs), and one that changes a couple deck backs (Deck-Backs), both using Malverk. 

To install:
  Download the .zip file, extract it, then put it into your Balatro Mods folder.
